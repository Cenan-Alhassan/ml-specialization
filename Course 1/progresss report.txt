1- file 3 is a complete linear regression implementation using gradient descent 
2- file 4 is a multiple feature linear regression model using gradient descent, completely self created (using numpy library and kaggle dataset)
3- file 5 is similar to file 4, except there are 4 features instead of 2, the data has been normalised for efficiency using pandas library,
 and actual vs predictions + cost vs iterations plotted with matplotlib
4- file 6 is the same as file 5, except using Scikit learn for the regression model and z score normalisation
5- file 7 is a univariate classification model with a cost vs coefficient plot
6- file 8 is the same as 7, except w was found with gradient descent
7- file 9 is a double feature implementation using scikit learn, data is plotted on a 2d graph using lab utilities
8- file 10 is a plot of before and after of applying regularized gradient descent in linear and logistic regression with a polynomial feature
