Read progress report text-file in each course folder for further details on the projects I have created.

SEE:

- Course 1 > 5. Multiple linear regression with feature scaling and cost vs iteration monitoring

A complete self-made linear regression model. Used to predict housing prices based on 4 attributes.
Using pandas for data manipulation, numpy for linear algebra and matplotlib for plotting graphs.


- Course 1 > 8. Univariate classification with gradient descent

A simple self-made logistic regression model that is trained to find a single coefficient. 
The sigmoid function is graphed against the linear function and its data points.
