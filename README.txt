Read progress report text-file in each course folder for further details on the projects I have created.

SEE:

- Course 1 > 5. Multiple linear regression with feature scaling and cost vs iteration monitoring

A complete self-made linear regression model. Used to predict housing prices based on 4 attributes.
Using pandas for data manipulation, numpy for linear algebra and matplotlib for plotting graphs.



- Course 1 > 8. Univariate classification with gradient descent

A simple self-made logistic regression model that is trained to find a single coefficient. 
The sigmoid function is graphed against the linear function and its data points.



- Course 1 > 10. Efects of regularization on linear and logistic regression

Shows the plot of the before and after of applying regularized gradient descent in both linear 
and logistic regression, when the training data has a polynomial feature
